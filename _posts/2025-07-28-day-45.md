what_i_learned: |
  July 28, 2025 we continue to try and finish the paper for this week. We also worked on our presentation that we have for this week. A good amount of progress have been made, we just have to make our finishing touches. Organzing the paper in order to be ready for publish is work. Been an eventful day putting everything together for the final week. Our group will continue to make great progress.

reflection: |
  July 28, 2025 reflecting on this being the last week and seeing the progress we made. We are trying our best to have a great final week. Getting the final paper and presentation ready requires attention to detail. We have became better scholars through this program and the ideas they have taught us. Using this information outside of Morgan State University will be helpful. I feel more prepared for the industry.

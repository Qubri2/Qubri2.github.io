what_i_learned: |
  July 28, 2025 we continue working on the paper to make sure all the sections have what's needed. It been a week, putting everything together took the work of everyone. Once we finished the presentation we can say we made it and we made a research project. Day after day of making progress we can say this project is our. Time has been moving fast and I don't think it intend on slowing down.

  No blockers for today.

reflection: |
  July 28, 2025 reflecting on everything is a process that everyone need to take and understand their journey. We been reflecting everyday to evaluate where we are at and where we are going. I still remember when we were back at bootcamp and everyone had to turn their camera on, good times. Now we are at the last week thinking about the final addition to our project. Time I have learned wait for no one, so you should take took long.

what_i_learned: |
  Today we talked about how to truly analyze a dataset. Dataset comes in different forms that need to be looked at before using its content. We must understand the different websites that have the data we need and how to filter those websites in order to obtain what we need. These are important factors that go into merging two datasets. We are trying to merge two datasets that cover different years and allow us to have one whole set. Discovering that there're multiple ways of doing this is very helpful. Learning python really has been an interesting experience. I'm discovering why people are considering it a beginner friendly programming language.

  

blockers: |
  Python being new to me is becoming less of an bloker and more as something I know how to do. Research is becoming more easy by the day. The only blocker would be analyzing a dataset. Cleaning it and using in a way to make a prediction model would be one of the only blocker. We are still learning taking our skill to the next level. Our team blockers are lessing by the day.

reflection: |
  The things I can reflect on today is seeing the progress I'm taking to take my python skills to the next level. I started this internship as an beginner in python, but the more I learn I feel like I will be a pro in no time. Working on a team allow us to see each other strength and weakness help each other in areas that are needed. This project will have a good outcome, we have been putting in great work in order to be successful. We are learning part by part of breaking down datasets and this is a important tool when working on a project.

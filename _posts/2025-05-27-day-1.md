what_i_learned: |
  I was introduced to the fundumentals of Git, Github, and Pthyon. I was also able to learn my group that I would be working with this summer. This was my first time using Github and was a execllent experience. I can see the pontential of using the software. We got to interact with each other through the game of jeopardy. Testing my pthon skills we had to take a placement test. We also played bingo to help us learn our collegue background. 

  I also started exploring how Python interfaces with the headset's BLE signals, preparing for real-time signal processing down the line.

blockers: |
  No blockers!

reflection: |
  I was able to expand my perspective of programming by seeing Github use in real-life scenarios such as our project. Using these tools "Git" and "Github" has great pontential of taking our research to the next level.

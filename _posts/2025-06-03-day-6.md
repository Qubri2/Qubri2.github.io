what_i_learned: |
  We started the day dicussing how we will conduct our research. Today we had to start our literature review. This would be composed of our summaries of articles we find and the citations. The citation format we will be using will be IEEE. The keywords I have to use for my research is "Prediction Model for Flight Delay". This will bring in information for my aspect of the overrall project. We used Morgan Library database for conduct our findings.

  

blockers: |
  There wasn't any blockers, we were able to work as a team and get the job done.

reflection: |
  Today really inform me how to make an literature review. I was informed that a literature review is just one component of an overall research paper. Literature review give us an idea of how other researchers are thinking and how we may be able to implement their techiques into our own. I gain knowledge of using morgan library as our main source of obtaining our literature review.

what_i_learned: |
  We started the day dicussing how we will conduct our research. Today we had to start our literature review. This would be composed of our summaries of articles we find and the citations. The citation format we will be using will be IEEE. The keywords I have to use for my research is "Prediction Model for Flight Delay". This will bring in information for my aspect of the overrall project. We used Morgan Library database for conduct our findings. Our goal was to have everyone find 15 research paper and summarize each one. We were introduce to an new software called "Zotero" that can take pdf and properly do the citations. Today was very useful in indulgening oursevles into proper research. This is how I feel the industry will be in the future. I'm glad I have an idea of what to expect. So far the "Flight Delay" project has been amazing and can't wait to see what is still in store in the future.

  

blockers: |
  There wasn't any blockers, we were able to work as a team and get the job done.

reflection: |
  Today really inform me how to make an literature review. I was informed that a literature review is just one component of an overall research paper. Literature review give us an idea of how other researchers are thinking and how we may be able to implement their techiques into our own. I gain knowledge of using morgan library as our main source of obtaining our literature review. We would be able to do something new.

what_i_learned: |
  July 28, 2025 we learned about working as a team to get the presentation and final paper together. We are getting closer and closer to the finish line. After the program we will be able to look back and seen all the amazing things we done. Learning is all about growing and trails/error. We took a lot the abilities from this project. I learned the way I communicate and learned. People perceive my knowledge a certain way and have to take that into consideration.

reflection: |
  July 28, 2025 I can reflect on the work done today and this week. Presentation and final paper took a toll on us but we coming back stronger than ever. I feel stronger than when I first started, I met alot of amazing people. I'm proud of the work our team have done. Reflecting on the future, past, and present is a huge process. I can't wait for the event this week at "Wonderfly". I believe this will be a fun event and get to see other people in the program. A day to relax after all this preparation for the final week.

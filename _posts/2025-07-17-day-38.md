what_i_learned: |
  July 17, 2025 today we went to the business building to learning about our writing and presentation style. This lecture was done by writing center and them giving their aspects. I've learned I should take the aspect of writing and presentation to add better style that can be enhanced. Today was interesting because the writing center was able to inform me of tradition within other nations. My perspective of how I should tackle things have definitely increased in volume.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  July 17, 2025 I can reflect on me mentally increasing my knowledge of presenting and writing. My confidence is forever increasing and becoming more fortified. Soon I will be a force that will be able to take on explaining technical ideas. I can definitely thank my team in helping in my evolution. I am not at my final form but soon I will be I'm glad the program have been helping me.

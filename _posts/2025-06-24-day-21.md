what_i_learned: |
  June 22, 2025 we have worked on breaking-down our dataset. We started looking at adding API to our data. The API will allow us to get historical data. We are able to find and put together all our columns. This has been an helpful day because we are a step closer to getting our full dataset. Using Kaggle has been helpful for us getting our data. We been testing our machine to merge our whole dataset which takes a lot of time. So far its all coming together.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be how can we have effective data that wouldn't be to much for our system to process when merging with API. The API have really tested our computers and we trying to figure out how to effectively handle the amount of data we have. We are just ensuring that we need all the data within our dataset. Just ensuring it reflects to the overall cause. This blocker we are most likely to resolve due to trail and error we tested today.

reflection: |
  June 22, 2025 I can reflect on the progress I have made in processing the ideas from my collegue and integrating it to the whole project. Making a whole team project like this takes alot of team effort and understanding. We all see the outcome and process differently. So it great to understand other people perspective and how can we make it work. I have a great team that's putting in a lot of work to make this work. Reflecting on my progress is great for future reference.

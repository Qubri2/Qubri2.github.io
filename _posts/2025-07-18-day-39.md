what_i_learned: |
  July 18, 2025 I had a dentist appointment. I was able to fill out the documentation. We were still able to do the zoom recording this week. I will be back on Monday July 21, 2025.

reflection: |
  July 18, 2025 I can reflect on our team still able to get the job done even if we all not here. We still try our best to accomplish what we need to.

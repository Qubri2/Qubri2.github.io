what_i_learned: |
  July 11, 2025 I was tasked to make the ScreenLit more detailed. Making the origin and destination airport more descriptive by adding "Avg Temp", "Weather affecting the delay", and "Avg Wind". This allowed the user to be more informed in the airport that being used. Not only did we add those features, but the prediction for that airline. Now that the user can add a airline the prediction will be based on that airline so the descprition can be more specific. I've learned that the more complex the code is the more error that can occur. 

  

blockers: |
  No Blocker for today. Upgrading ScreenLit Dashboard.

reflection: |
  July 11, 2025 I can reflect on the the stage I'm at with coding by now working with complex code. These codes have a lot of implementation to make sure everything work. This project have definitely taking levels. Making reflections everyday help remind me how far I've come. I'm still making progress and at this rate we will have a great project. This week was very productive.

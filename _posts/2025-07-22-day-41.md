what_i_learned: |
  July 22, 2025 today we had to work on our elevator pitch video. We had different sections that everyone would talk about. It took multiple tries to try to get a good outcome. The group wanted BWI as the scene and background. We came out with a good outcome.

reflection: |
  July 22, 2025 I can reflect on our hard work. It took a lot for us to make this scene at BWI. I’m glad we were able to accomplish it. Today was an interesting day and very eventful. We are a proud team.

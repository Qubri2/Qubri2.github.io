what_i_learned: |
  During today session we had to analyze vidoes that implements similar methods that we are doing. We had multiple videos to go through. These videos included using kaggle to obtain the dataset then clean it with a series of processes. The datasets could have different missing components that could mess with the final product/results. We are going through this process before we test the method on the actual data with flight delays. I learned about the complexity of datasets. One of the video the person actually misunderstood the file he downloaded and had to go back to download the rest. As the viewer I was able to see his method of going back to kaggle and unzip the file to add to his dataset. The person within the video shown a lot of method of surfing through his computer by strictly using his terminal. This method was new to me. The video explained running code but by seperate sections. Sometime its easier to watch someone do live coding then someone strictly only doing a turtorial. With this way you can see the code in actual use.

  

blockers: |
  Python being new to me is becoming less of an bloker and more as something I know how to do. Research is becoming more easy by the day. The only blocker would be analyzing a dataset. Cleaning it and using in a way to make a prediction model would be one of the only blocker. We are still learning taking our skill to the next level. Our team blockers are lessing by the day.

reflection: |
  The things I can reflect on today is seeing the progress I'm taking to take my python skills to the next level. I started this internship as an beginner in python, but the more I learn I feel like I will be a pro in no time. Working on a team allow us to see each other strength and weakness help each other in areas that are needed. This project will have a good outcome, we have been putting in great work in order to be successful. We are learning part by part of breaking down datasets and this is a important tool when working on a project.

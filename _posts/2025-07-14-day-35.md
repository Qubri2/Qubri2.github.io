what_i_learned: |
  July 14, 2025 we were trying to combine our work together. This includes combining the website and dashboard together. Our goal is the have the dashboard accessible through the website. This will allow users to use the prediction model online. We are running into a LOT of errors. Our team is trying our best to fixs these errors. The file being too large is a huge problem.

  

blockers: |
  The blocker would be getting Streamlit and the website to work with each other. First the website is through "GitHub". Uploading our GB file to Github won't work, the file is too big. I tried to using google drive to hold the file, but it won't read the file when the code is ran. Google Drive goes through security check before accessing the file which can also cause problem. The StreamLit is ran locally when created but locally is not accessible to the public easily. Our team with the help of other lab members tried "Git", it still didn't work. I tried "gdown" which also didn't work, I tried google going around the security google do on file, IT DIDN'T WORK.

reflection: |
  July 14, 2025 reflecting on all the hard work we put in today is very interesting. We been using our technical expertise to try and get the job done. Our reflection I believe everyone can see, we always look back to see how far we came. Day by day we are closer to the end. Our team are making head-way.

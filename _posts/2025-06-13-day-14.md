what_i_learned: |
  June 13, 2025 we discussed our video we have to make for our "weekly video". We had time to structure it and present it properly. Our team have also analyzed our plans for next week of merging our dataset to the actual prediction model. As we were doing research on the data and creating visualizations we discovered we may do multiple visual representations and split them evenly. This may be more time efficient. First we may figure out how we want to display the data of the prediction model. We have also looked into kaggle course to enhance our programming.

  

blockers: |
  The only blockers would be fully understanding what a command line fully do. Seeing multiple command lines work together in order to get a certain result can be interesting. Sometimes you have command lines that shorten other lines. Putting complex codes together can help big project. I'm still learning complex code but its still a learning process.

reflection: |
  June 13, 2025 reflection was based on seeing our how we can use our python skill to the next level but adding viusaliztion. I'm glad that I'm evolving as a person this is helpful for my progress as a person. Today has been a learning experience due using communication skill, python skills, and critical thinking skills. Putting all these skills set together is great work. Our project and team have been working well together to get the job done. I believe this will be a great experience for everyone.

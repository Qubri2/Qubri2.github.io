what_i_learned: |
  July 07, 2025 we researched making a dashboard using a third party website to host the code. We want to use "Streamlit" and "Plotly" to host our dashborad. Our code would be uploaded to GitHub. I was tasked to work on Stream lit, from there I can connect StreamLit to Github dirctly. This method may be esier for now, due to not having to make a dashboard from scratch. We talked about how we felt after the presentaion on Thursday. Everyone felt pretty good on they way the presented.

  

blockers: |
  The blocker would be getting Streamlit fully working

reflection: |
  July 07, 2025 I can reflect on the developmet of this project. We stared from how can we create this model to now we making a dashboad that can be interactive for anyone to use. Our team I believe can reflect on our great development and process we took to make an successful project. This project brought out different sides to everyone that we all can reflect on. We are consistently trying to make ourselves better. This kind of development takes time. We being using our time wisely and continue to do so.

what_i_learned: |
  June 17, 2025 we have fully finished our learning foundation on kaggle and started applying our knowledge. Today we started organizing our dataset to get it ready for our model. We analyze our dataset to find features that we needed and didn't need. This took some time and we even found more data to use. We have became more organized as a team by learning how we can contribute to the overall cause. Today was a learning experience to see what and where we can evole on.

  

blockers: |
  No blockers today, we are putting the foundation of our project together day by day.

reflection: |
  June 17, 2025 reflection for me was being able to communicate my ideas to my team. Being able to explain in a certain way what I'm thinking so my team can understand is helpful in the long run. It makes progress easier if everyone understand each other and not feel the need to make assumptions. I could reflect on a lot of aspects today that always go beyond research. This program brings different out different traits of a person that you will have to face. I'm seeing my quailty now.

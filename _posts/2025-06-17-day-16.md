what_i_learned: |
  June 16, 2025 we worked on mostly kaggle interactive teaching of programming. We are using this learning experience to apply to our dataset we have for our prediction model. Our dataset is a large file filled with different aspects of flight. This range from weather, airport, airline, etc. Kaggle teaching our group different methods of using python. Instead of only focusing on analyzing dataset with pandas, we get to see python as a whole. I feel like my learning experience been great with python especially since I'm around people that understand python more than me.

  No blockers today, we are putting the foundation of our project together day by day.

reflection: |
  June 16, 2025 reflection for me includes seeing the progress "The Flyers" have made since day 1. We have been researching way of putting this prediction model together. Seeing other article and how they are structured is an insight of what we may have to do. I'm proud of the progress my team have been making these last few weeks. We came a long way from our knowledge at the beginning. I have became stronger as a person not only from a learning aspect, but from a spiritual too.

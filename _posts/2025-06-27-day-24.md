what_i_learned: |
  June 27, 2025 the large dataset with multi-year flights finally finished. We can now use this dataset set to obtain more accurate results. First we tested the model with just two months to see how the model would operate, now we tested it with the large dataset. Once we entered the large .csv final to the model we did encounter a good amount of errors. We fixes the errors, they were based on our features. The model is running but we still need to make adjustments to it. For now we made a version called "XGBoost 3.0". This version is adjusted for the large dataset. "XGBoost 2.0" was also tested and adjusted first for the large dataset is running fine. The 3.0 is being worked on to be more enhanced and hopefully have user interface implemented. Within the first version and 2.0 we had to keep maunally enter the origin and desentation airport with the date within the code. With the 3.0 version we want to simplify it for any user to download and use. So far "XGBoost 2.0" is giving us lower accuracy and we are still determing 3.0 accuracy. The project is coming along. We haven't forgotten about "Random Forest. It seem to work first try, it took in the feature we wanted which was surprising to me. We are going to call the "Random Forest" with the large dataset "Random Forest 2.0" and make adjustments as needed. Our prediction models are running we just need to make adjustments in needed places.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would getting XGBoost 2.0 to work with our new large dataset. It took some time but eventually it started running normal. We are still working on the accuracy. But for now the XGBoost can take our dataset we plan to use. The next step is for an user interface to simplfy it a little more. The code may become a little more complex but I believe we can handle the adjustment. I'm glad that the prediction models are seperated in versions so we can see what we did right before. This helps us before we step into uncharted territory.

reflection: |
  June 27, 2025 I can reflect on the progress I've made in my role to help work on the "XGBoost" and "Random Forest". Being able to get both running and make needed adjustments took time but its running. We been using our time to the best of our ability. This week I believe we made some big break throughs. Our group are already discussing the next step to take this project futher. We have seen the progress we made.

what_i_learned: |
  June 20, 2025 we researched on how the team can make XGBoost work with our data. Within XGBoost you can already include code that will help clean the data but we decided to clean our code before hand. I've learned more about training models and how to operate them. Today we enhance our skills in seperating tasks and coming together with our results. My job was to work more on the predictive model we will be using. The model is coming along day by day and implementation are being made.

  

blockers: |
  No blocker for today, our team working together is making our tasks easier.

reflection: |
  June 20, 2025 I can reflect on the person I'm becoming by working on a team. Being able to work on my part and bring it to the overall goal is definitely game changing. My team is definitely helping me become a better more enhanced person. I am proud of the accomplishments I have done so far. I've done good in the work and evolvtion of building my character. Feeling evolve is great progress for me and glad I can reflect on it.

what_i_learned: |
  June 18, 2025 we researched on how the team can make XGBoost work with our data. Within XGBoost you can already include code that will help clean but we decided to clean our code before hand.

  

blockers: |
  A blocker I feel like I am overcoming is properly putting my words together for others to understand. As the days go by I feel more and more confident in being in this field. Presenting infront of people always been fun for me, but for me to explain technical problems is next level. I feel stronger as a person and see my development. This program has really help me get outside my comfort zone. I'm just glad I'm making progress as a person. These blogs help with my development.

reflection: |
  June 18, 2025 reflection for me would be becoming a stronger in presentation. I want to become stronger in structuring my words better, so other people can understand me more. Today exercises have really build me up as a person. Just taking everything a day at a time. I'm proud of the group I have and the dynamic we have been building. I feel like everyday I come in, I'm just more prepared for the industry ahead of me.

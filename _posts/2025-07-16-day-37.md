what_i_learned: |
  July 16, 2025 today we had our dashboard link and now configuring it to work on our website. We making progress to get a fully function system. Soon this will be a product that can be access through the public. A website is a great step forward to make this happen. Our system is user friendly and interactive. Making a system easy to understand is within our setup. We are also adding feature to the website such as USA heat-map of busy delay areas.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  July 17, 2025 I can reflect on our inspiration we give each other. We inspire each other to keep going and become a stronger version of theirself. Today team exercise we talked about body language and how we observe or demonstrate those languages. Our project is definitely coming along. Now that the website has the dashboard we overcame another challenge.

  July 16, 2025 today we had our dashboard link and now configuring it to work on our website. We making progress to get a fully function system. Soon this will be a product that can be access through the public. A website is a great step forward to make this happen. Our system is user friendly and interactive. Making a system easy to understand is within our setup.

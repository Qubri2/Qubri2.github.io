what_i_learned: |
  July 15, 2025 we had to meet at the business building to do a group activity. Today we were able to learn about our learning method and our personality. We made slides in order to be able to a small presentation for all the other groups. This was helpful because I learned things about my learning method and personality I didn't know before. I also learned how can we build as a team.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  July 15, 2025 reflection was learning more about myself and my team members. Not only my group but all the groups within the program. This was helpful for me to evolve and become a better person. I learned that I am "VERY STRONG KINESTHETIC, ENFP". This can help me later in the future because I can gear my everyday movements to these style since it comes naturally to me.

what_i_learned: |
  June 18, 2025 we worked on team building by presenting infront of the class and working on our presentation skiils. This helped me alot because I do like talking infront of people, I find enjoyment from it. One part of the presentation was for us to practice introducing ourselves to our new High School Mentor. The High school Mentor had to guess the project name by us using certain keywords different than out project name. We did an activity if we were stranded on a life-raft what would be the most important items for us based on a list. The teams had to present their ideas to the other groups. The other groups could make disputes if they wanted too. Our group was happy to meet our High School Mentor "Mrs. Burke". She would be joining our team to build this project. A very good day indeed.

  

blockers: |
  A blocker I feel like I am overcoming is properly putting my words together for others to understand. As the days go by I feel more and more confident in being in this field. Presenting infront of people always been fun for me, but for me to explain technical problems is next level. I feel stronger as a person and see my development. This program has really help me get outside my comfort zone. I'm just glad I'm making progress as a person. These blogs help with my development.

reflection: |
  June 18, 2025 reflection for me would be becoming a stronger in presentation. I want to become stronger in structuring my words better, so other people can understand me more. Today exercises have really build me up as a person. Just taking everything a day at a time. I'm proud of the group I have and the dynamic we have been building. I feel like everyday I come in, I'm just more prepared for the industry ahead of me.

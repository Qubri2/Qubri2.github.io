what_i_learned: |
  June 26, 2025 I've learned about group evolution and not just my own. Making sure my whole group have communication skills for example presentaion. Ensuring that the whole group have the confidence to present infront of an large crowd. This is part of team building. I learned that some people have strnegth in some areas and weaknesses in others doesn't means for the person with strength in an area just to fill in for the others weakness, but to help the other person work on those weaknesses. We practice presenting in front of our group. Doing this get us prepare for the presentation next week. Our High School Teacher was able to give us critiques on our presentation skills. This program is a learning experience for everyone. We been working a lot for this research and putting all the pieces together to get good overall results. I worked on making a better version of XGBoost and calling it "XGBoost 2.0". This supposed to be more effective than yesterday model. This is done by making the features within the model stand out more. 

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be building the "XGBoost 2.0" model I configured. I want it to be better and more effective than the first version. So far it seem to predict the same outcome. The features are a tiny bit more in-depth. This may not be a con so far, it just means our features are bound to give these results. Understanding the full length of these models could be a blocker, but I'm starting to understand how they work. I haven't tested a "Random Forest 2.0" with a tiny bit more in-depth features. But our model is a working progress.

reflection: |
  June 25, 2025 these reflection are big for my development. I have reflected on the hard work we put in to get this project working. It does take time, but I'm glad we are trying our best. Expanding my knowledge day by day is great. Our group have came a long way from day one. I'm definitely stronger ask a person by working together as a group to obtain a common goal.

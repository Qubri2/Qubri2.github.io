what_i_learned: |
  During today session we had to analyze vidoes that implements similar methods that we are doing. We had multiple videos to go through. These videos included using kaggle to obtain the dataset then clean it with a series of processes. The datasets could have different missing components that could mess with the final product/results. We are going through this process before we test the method on the actual data with flight delays. I learned about the complexity of datasets. One of the video the person actually misunderstood the file he downloaded and had to go back to download the rest. As the viewer I was able to see his method of going back to kaggle and unzip the file to add to his dataset. The person within the video shown a lot of method of surfing through his computer by strictly using his terminal. This method was new to me. The video explained running code but by seperate sections. Sometime its easier to watch someone do live coding then someone strictly only doing a turtorial. With this way you can see the code in actual use.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker I would have is reaching the next level as a person. Evolution is needed in order to become your best self. Doing research is only one step towards that direction. It's up to me to that extra step to see a new door. Research has help break down other people's ideas and see what we can add to our research. Blockers are being knocked down day by day. I see myself evolving as an engineer.

reflection: |
  I have a lot to reflect on today. The process of putting a research paper together requires a lot of aspects. These apects includes communication, research, learning weaknesses, and deep thinking. In order to create something we truly have to understand what we are creating. This is easier said than done. Everyone within the project have different perspectives of how to process certain problems. Understanding the next person perspective really help opening up your own. This is useful for everyday life we can use this in other areas outside of research. The idea of your research being used to create a difference in the whole is very interesting. A flight delay prediction have lots of usage within airports all over the world. I can reflect on the evolution of a person I am becoming day by day. This is a process that happens when your everyday self is challenged and has to evole. I feel like I on a next level, by tackling complex problems that comes to me and solving it to the best my ability. Python was a forgein language to me, and everyday it's becoming easier.

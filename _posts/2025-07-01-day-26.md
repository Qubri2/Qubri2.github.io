what_i_learned: |
  July 01, 2025 we focus on confirming that all our code works. We organized our code ready for the demo on Thursday. We now have our base model with XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM for Time series. Our team is definitely ready for the mid presentation, we put a lot of effort into this. We made a lot of progress from where we started. I feel confident in the work we done and the presentation as a whole. 

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be ensuring everything is ready for Thursday. We accomplished ensuring everything works.

reflection: |
  July 01, 2025 today was very interesting, for our team building exercise we were able to open up and communicate about our past. We were tasked to write a letter to our past self and express what would you say to them. It was a very interesting, fun, and emotional exercise. Seeing my group opening up about their journey allows you to see them in a different light. I wasn't expecting this today, but I believe it brought the team closer together. I want to thank Kyle our High School teacher for introducing us to this activity.

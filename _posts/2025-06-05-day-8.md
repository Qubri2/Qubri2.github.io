what_i_learned: |
  Today the program did a tour around Morgan to get a better understanding of our surroundings. It was fun even though I already go to Morgan, I was able to see some of the new buildings and gain some new knowledge. I visited a food spot called "Sunny Subs" today for the first time near the business building. I feel more confident being in the summer program, meeting new people have been a fun experience.

  

blockers: |
  Not many blocker today. We were able to overcome understanding complex dataset. My understanding have improved in understanding flight delayed prediction model. The only blocker would be improving my coding. Python is still new to me and had been a great programming language so far.

reflection: |
  Today was an amazing day seeing the program in a different light. Being able to do a tour around Morgan allow me to get a reminder of how great Morgan is. I love walking across campus seeing the atmosphere. We had to discuss our literature review that we finished and confirmed what we did. We had to present today just confirming our literature review. This has boost my confidence in another level.

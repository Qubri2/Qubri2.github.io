what_i_learned: |
  July 08, 2025 today I continue my task of implementing streamlit with our project. I have able to get a test dashboard working. It took some time, but working out a few errors was able to get it working. We are very close to having a full system, that will be easy to use and user friendly. I also try running our new and more efficient code. This code takes a lot of time to run. We are trying to get the model at 90%. The more accurate the model is the more we can rely on it. The prediction model we have is thankfully almost ready for real-world use. 

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be getting streamlit working. I was getting a good amount of errors to get it working properly. First I tried running our code on GitHub, so I can connect the GitHub directly to streamlit. Doing this I had to have the .csv file on google drive because the file may be too large for GitHub. So the file was on google drive, but for some reason it would not read on streamlit. We came to the conclusion that it just a limitation to large file being read through websites. Next option was running it directly from the IDE, which worked but based on my code streamlit didn't know what to display. Last step taken was changing the code to be fully operatioal with screenlit.

reflection: |
  July 08, 2025 today was a very good reflective day. We been working at our best to make this project the best as possible. It takes a lot of beleif in ourselves to push to that next level. I'm glad we are able to innovate into futher steps to take this project beyond. Our group will have a lot of great things to show for the final presentaion. We already put a lot of work into this and came up with great result. I feel like these are great things to reflect on.

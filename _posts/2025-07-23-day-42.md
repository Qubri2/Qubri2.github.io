reflection: |
  July 23, 2025 I can reflect the progress we made on the final paper to explain our prediction model. Our paper is a combination of everything we have done and how the public can utilize our model. Our website has the prediction model included and information about the project. We came a long way to finally get the website working especially getting the dashboard and the website to work together. I'm glad we have a full interactive website for users to gain viable information. This project has a lot of pontential to make huge change.

what_i_learned: |
  July 21, 2025 we had to go to the business building to get an overview of how we will finish up the program. First we talked about our elevator pitch then the final paper. The elevator pitch has to be 90 seconds and be very exciting. For the final paper we must use Overleaf and the given format. We got an idea today of how to use it and enter information. Once we got back to the lab we work on our paper. We split the paper into different section for people to work on.

what_i_learned: |
  July 09, 2025 today I use our prediction model code that is fully done on the dashboard. First I was using a test version to make sure that StreamLit works, which it does. Now that tested it with our full model things have changed. We can now as for user input on a website setting. Next we have to attach the dashboard to the website. We want the website to be a central place for everything related to our project. This project is evolving by the day. We did a team building exercise that was very fun. We opened up about improvisation and dealing with stress. Today team building was definitely helpful for me to reflect on myself.

  No Blocker for today. We was able to apply the current model.

reflection: |
  July 09, 2025 I can reflect on the evolution of the project. We have came a long way from bootcamp. I'm proud of the work our team have done. Especially these last few weeks. The week of the presentation we push ourselves to the next level to have everything ready. Our group still have more to show and innovate.

what_i_learned: |
  June 30, 2025 we started working on LSTM for Time Series. This objective was new for me and I was thinking of different ways to approach it. It took awhile by we were able to obtain a graph that has our histortical data and predict future data. This gave us a great visual of the possibilities we can do with this model. Our group have also started working on a website for our project. We wanted an interactive website that can implement our flight delay user interface.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be understanding Time Series. This is my first time working on LSTM for Time Series. I glad we were able to get some great results. We are still making addition to the code.

reflection: |
  June 30, 2025 I can reflect on the contributions we are making to society but implementing a system that predicts flight delay. The benefit of this system have the possibility to give reults to cilivians and airports. If airport was able to use this with their system it would change the way humans fly to their destination. This project is definitely game changing. I'm also reflecting on how much I've been coding, it feel like this the most I ever coded in my life. Today was definitely a for the better.

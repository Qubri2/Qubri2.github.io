what_i_learned: |
  We started the day within the business building and got started with an introduction. This allows everything to meet each other. We answered questions about the different perspectives about AI. This allowed us to see the different aspects. Everyone having different backgrounds will bring in many skills set to the group. We were able to find our research lab. Within the research lab we discuss how we can obtain information. This included using google scholar, IEEE database, or morgan library. My goal for today was to do specific research on “Prediction Model for flight delay”. We had to gather literature reviews.

  

blockers: |
  There wasn't any blockers for today. We were gathering the basic on doing research as a team.

reflection: |
  I was able to work with my project team within the lab. This gave me an idea of the environment we will be working in during the summer. It was great to see the dynamic of everyone from the program as a whole and from individuals as a person. Going to the research meeting meeting other collegue that working on other project was real great. This open my eyes of what it would be like to work on a research team within the industry.

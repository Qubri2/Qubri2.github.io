what_i_learned: |
  July 10, 2025 today we were tasked to go to the business building to listen and engage with the writing center about writing. The team talked about writing in all aspect from literature review to writing a full report. This was very informative in teaching me how to structure technical ideas especially in engineering. We were very happy with the knowledge the center have provided to us. After the writing lecture was over we continued to work on our project. I continue my work in making StreamLit better.

  No Blocker for today. Testing better version of ScreenLit.

reflection: |
  July 10, 2025 I can reflect on the process of the program from every Thursday learning doing program varies actives to team building once a week. This program has a lot to offer to build ones character. My character is developing by the day I'm pretty proud of that. I have a lot of talent now to show to the outside world. Reflection reminds me of how far I came from the beginning.

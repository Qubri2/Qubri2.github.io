what_i_learned: |
  June 24, 2025 we have discussed taking a portion of the dataset to see if the model work. Our dataset is a very large file and will take a lot of time to process. So we actually got our model working and tested future predictions for test. We scale for two months worth of data for right now and plan to use our multi-year data once we make the right correction to the current model. Our current model actually tell us if there's a delay our not. XGBoost took awhile to get it properly running but we finally got it. We plan to use the large file to predict delay within all months of the year.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be getting XGBoost working. Running into errors was a common occurrence. There's multiple file that need to be downloaded to get it started. These files have to be in the right loctaion for XGBoost to recongize.

reflection: |
  June 24, 2025 reflecting on the person I am today verus the person I was yesterday or last year, I'm definitely an upgrade. I've been pushing myself to need heights that will make me a more defined person. Reflection on my ability to understand my errors not just as an engineer but as a regular person. Sometimes I remind myself that I'm a regular person that took up engineering one day. To be in the position to finally use what I trained for all these years is great. I want to continue becoming better.

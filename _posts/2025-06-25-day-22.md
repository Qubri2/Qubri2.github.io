what_i_learned: |
  June 25, 2025 my role today was to now work on "Random Forest" which is another prediction model. The progress is pretty well, the code does run a little differently than XGBoost. Working on Random Forest has definitely been interesting for today. Now that we have two prediction model to help us get accurate result for flight delay we can make better progress. I've learned it only takes that one step to learn something new and see how much you can take from it. Our project dynamic is truly coming along.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be now understanding Random Forest.

reflection: |
  June 25, 2025 reflection is a big deal for me. I do that time to see the person I was before and the person I am today. Evolving is a must if you want to make great progress. Making progress that involves me becoming stronger is a must for me. Reflecting on how I've became an expert on some areas and learning in others.

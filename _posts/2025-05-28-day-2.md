what_i_learned: |
  We started by learning about our project more deeply by meeting our mentors. This was useful because it allows everyone to be on the same page. We went over python 101 through a slideshow which tackle all the basic of pthyon. Our collegue played kahoot and a "what am I" game to do more interaction. This helped me establish what I had learned. 

  

blockers: |
  No Blocker.

reflection: |
  I'm seeing a evolution of opening my perspective of python by tackling the basic. I am more encourage to take my baisc skills futher.

what_i_learned: |
  Today we discuss taking our project to the next level. We were discussing a method flight delay prediction models use that could be more efficient than the ones we already have. Its still in the working process of discovering if this is the way to go. So far we have our data that we will implement to into our prediction model. We plan to implement this data enitrly. Adding this data to a prediction model and seeing what results we may get is very interesting. This project has came a long way from where it started. So far "The Flyers" are making great progress.

  

blockers: |
  The only blockers would be fully understanding what a command line fully do. Seeing multiple command lines work together in order to get a certain result can be interesting. Sometimes you have command lines that shorten other lines. Putting complex codes together can help big project. I'm still learning complex code but its still a learning process.

reflection: |
  I can reflect on the progress our group have made together as a team. This project takes discussion and discovery in order to reach a certain level. Today we had to test our knowledge to see if the material of python is being used. My python skill have increased today and continue to increase. I'm able to reflect on the becoming an evolve person. Even though I'm an electrical engineer I've been learning the skills of CS majors. This has been an great journey.

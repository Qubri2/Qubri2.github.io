what_i_learned: |
  Today we analyzed more documents/articles on kaggle to go along with our project. This took some time due to many articles being about different aspects of flight delay. We are trying to look for articles that would be an asset towards our predictive model. Our predictive model is coming along still pieces we must put together. With the new article we obtained dealing we analyzing the human involvment with operating a task with machine being involved we be a big help with us.

  

blockers: |
  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today's tasks was an eye opener due to the article we have to scroll through on kaggle that may talk about other apsects that may not be related to our project. This project takes time to fully excute in order to obtain the best results. So far our team have been working hard to put this project together. I see my self evolving everyday from all aspects not just coding and research. I'm becoming a better version of myself.

what_i_learned: |
  July 25, 2025 today we went to the business building and discovered research about electrical wave through the brain also the are muscle. These head devices that read the brain waves measure the intensity of waves to create movement on different devices/system. The devices we used for example was a drone that fly based on the brain wave information that being read. Back in the lab we worked our final paper.

reflection: |
  July 25, 2025 reflection was based on seeing other project from a different university. See Dr. Crawford present not only his findings but his experience from his life. We all people at the end of the day and can learn from each other. I'm glad I seen this project and the potential it became. Reflection show the greatness that can be accomplished with years of works.

what_i_learned: |
  We continue our research for the finding article review for our project. With the continuous of our research we applied it to the group literature review. This literature review is made up of all our aspects to the overrall project. Our goal was 60 articles. We were able to finished this part of the project today. After obaining the literature review, we have made summaries of how the article would pretain to our project. Now that we had the summaries our goal was to present it to our mentor. This help encourage my confident when speaking infront of people. When infront of people its always good to try and remember what the article is about so the person you are explaining infront of can understand. So that the best thing for me to do. I understood the knowledge that authors from that article I obatin were trying to say. I am able to explain that deeply in techincal terms for people to gain the details. Our team "The Flyers" had to present in our lab to build our confidence. It was definitely a learning experience because its something I can be better at. Our goal was to present our literature review and describe/summarize or findings. I have found a lot of interesting data today. This data includes the different sytles that researchers decides to approach flight delay problem.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be understanding some of the complexity of the prediction model being used in the algrorim. I was able to overcome this by reading multiple articles and seeing other researcher aspects. I feel confindent enough to go into topics I don't know and conduct research on it. Research is just taking things a step at a time. I was okay with my blocker today because it allowed me to overcome it. I feel like this won't be a blocker for me anymore.

reflection: |
  Today was an amazing day to bring my research into a new level. Writing this literature have been a lot of work but when you have a team it makes it better. I love my team and the progress we have made in these last few days. I can see this project really coming along. I am excited to see what the end result will be after all our ideas comes together and create something new. Abiola have really been a big help for us. She have shown us how the industry is really conducted in the real world. Dr. Kofi Nyarko have really shown us how to structure a team to gain the best results. Our team at this state feels unstoppable and ready to tackle problems.

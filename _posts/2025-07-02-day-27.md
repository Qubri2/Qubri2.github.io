what_i_learned: |
  July 02, 2025 we continue trying to prepare everything for presentation. So far we ran into a few bumps trying to get everything ready for the video. It was a good amount of work to get everything in order. I still believe we are 100% ready for the presentation tomorrow. It took a lot of energy to get where we are at. We are constantly working to get a great product. Our group has great results just putting it all together.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be getting our WHOLE model working for the video.

reflection: |
  July 02, 2025 reflection we are working at our finest I believe. Everyone trying their hardest to get the best final product. Constantly looking at code all day can be interesting. Reflecting on where we were before preparing for a presentation and after preparing for a presentation is also interesting. The amount of work this is taking to make flight delay prediction is something to reflect on. I believe its all part of the process to get the job done. Soon we will have what we work hard for.

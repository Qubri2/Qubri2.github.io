what_i_learned: |
  Today we had to research how to obtain different dataset from multiple resources in order to have data to use for our prediction model. These reseources included FAA and Bureau of Transportation. Our goal for today was to figure out how to combine two datasets to use in our prediction model. This function of python was new to me and a great learning experience. I'm proud that I'm learning more techiques in a short amount of time.

  

blockers: |
  The only blocker would be understanding the complexity of python. Python is still new to me and have lots of techique used within the programing language. Its good to learn it now because it's still one of the most popular language used.

reflection: |
  Today was very informative taking my techiques to the next level. I've done a lot of learning with importing files into my python software. We needed to do this in order to figure out how to merged two .csv files together.

  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently studying at Morgan State University for a bachelor in electrical engineering. I'm on a research team for our senior design project with the goal to prevent passive attacks on a trustee network.

    I love diving into hardware components of computers such as graphics and processors. Building computers from scratch has always been a passion of mines. Being part of this internship will increase my skills within software and coding which hardware definently need.

    Building computer and doing research by looking at computer stats online is something I love doing. Every year when AMD and NVIDIA release their lastest product I'm probably looking at the hardware stats.
